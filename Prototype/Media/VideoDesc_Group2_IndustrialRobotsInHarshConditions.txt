This video presents a method for rock bolt assembly using a robot manipulator. The project was done in the ROBO.666 Robotics Project Work course, 2024-2025-1 implementation. 

A proposal for rock bolt assembly was first made and simulated at full scale. Then, the functionality was verified with a smaller prototype in one of the universityâ€™s laboratories.
